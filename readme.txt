Places a customized Quote of the Day on your site from TooManyQuotes.com. Uses Asynchronous JavaScript so your website will NEVER slow down waiting for the script to load. Lets you easily choose from over 300 popular quote topics and authors. Or if you want absolute control over the quotes displayed on your blog, create a new list of quotes on TooManyQuotes.com and get the custom Quote of the Day code.

== Description ==

This Wordpress widget places a Quote of the Day from [TooManyQuotes.com](http://www.toomanyquotes.com) onto your website. It uses AYNCHRONOUS JavaScript to ensure that it will NEVER slow down your own website or delay any rendering times (same technology used by Facebook and Google Analytics).

By default this plugin will display quotes from our list of personally-approved Quote of the Day quotes, but you can visit [the Quote of the Day generator page](http://www.toomanyquotes.com/quote_of_the_day/generator) to get the JavaScript code for any quote topic, author, actor, movie, TV show, book, video game or custom List.

Simply choose from over 300 of our most popular quote topics and authors in the dropdown, or if you'd rather have absolute control over your quotes then create your own list and copy the custom script from TooManyQuotes.com into the textarea. Simply make your own List of quotes on TooManyQuotes.com, then get the Quote of the Day script from your list!

Check out the [TooManyQuotes Quote of the Day generator page](http://www.toomanyquotes.com/quote_of_the_day/generator) for more information.

See the bottom right sidebar of the [Ruby On Rails Gallery](http://www.rubyonrailsgallery.com) to see this plugin in use. [RubyOnRailsGallery.com](http://www.rubyonrailsgallery.com) uses a custom List of quotes. You can create your own List of quotes that work well for your website, then use that list for your Quote of the Day.

== Installation ==

Just like any other sidebar widget:

1. Upload `qotd.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the Quote of the Day widget in your sidebar
4. Choose from over 300 of the most popular quote topics and authors, or get the JavaScript for a different Quote of the Day and copy it to the widget's settings.
